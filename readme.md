# The Game of Life
## Description
This is my first js project as an assignment when I was studying fulltime at Tecky Academy, a programming bootcamp that I attended in 2020.

## Introduction
Also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

## Instruction
- Player chooses an initial set up.
- Rules are applied to see what happens in the next generation.
- Press the "Stop Game" button to pause the game, press again to resume the game.
- Players can draw freely when the game is paused.
- Reset game by the reset button
